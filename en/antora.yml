      This document defines the principles that all members of the Decidim
      project (individual, collective or institutional) are committed to follow.
      1. Decidim will always remain free and open to collaboration, without
      legal or technical obstacles for the use, copy and modification. To ensure
      this we use a set of free licenses for the code, the content (text,
      images, design, etc.) and data. This means that Decidim will always remain
      auditable, collaborable, transparent, appropriable and trustworthy, all of
      which is fundamental for a democratic infrastructure. 2. The content of
      participation will always remain transparent, traceable and integral. This
      means that all the content must be accessible and downloadable, it should
      always be known what happens with each proposal, its origin, in which
      result or decision is was incorporated or why it was rejected or left
      behind, and the content needs to be displayed without been manipulated,
      any modification (if required) must be registered and be accessible and
      auditable. 3. Equal opportunities: “The platform will offer equal starting
      opportunities to all participatory objects (proposals, debates, etc.) for
      them to be viewed, discussed, commented, evaluated or treated without
      discrimination of any kind” (direct quote from the contract). 4.
      Participants must retain privacy of their personal data combined with
      verification of their democratic rights. 5. Democratic quality and
      guarantees: the platform must guarantee the democratic quality, the
      non-discrimination and equal opportunities for each participant and
      proposal. 6. Inclusiveness and multilayerness: the platform must comply
      with accessibility standards, its use must favour the integration of
      online and offline participation and organizations must deploy the means
      for mediation and training of participants.

      The core of this document was first prepared as the content of the
      inter-institutional agreement that Barcelona City Council signed with
      Localret consortia of Catalan city councils on February the 1st 2017. On
      that day the following city council endorsed the agreement: L’Hospitalet
      de Llobregat, Terrassa, Sabadell, Badalona, Gavà and Sant Cugat del
      Vallès. The original title of this first agreement was "Code of democratic
      guarantees and open collaboration". It was latter simply called "social
      contract" and extended to public contracts with service providers and
      developers of the platform and the to the Decidim community as a whole.
